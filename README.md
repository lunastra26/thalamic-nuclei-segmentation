# Convolutional Neural Network based Thalamic Nuclei Segmentation for MPRAGE images
Thalamic nuclei have been implicated in several neurological diseases. White-Matter-nulled Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (WMn-MPRAGE) images have been shown to provide better intra-thalamic nuclear contrast compared to conventional MPRAGE images but the additional acquisition results in increased examination times. 

In this work, we investigated 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based techniques for thalamic nuclei parcellation from conventional MPRAGE images. Two 3D CNNs were developed and compared for thalamic nuclei parcellation using MPRAGE images: a) a native contrast segmentation (NCS) and b) a synthesized contrast segmentation (SCS) using WMn-MPRAGE images synthesized from MPRAGE images. We trained the two segmentation frameworks using MPRAGE images (n=35) and thalamic nuclei labels generated on WMn-MPRAGE images using a multi-atlas based parcellation technique.
